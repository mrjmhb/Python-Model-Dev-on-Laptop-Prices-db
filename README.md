# Python-Model-Dev-on-Laptop-Prices-db
Python Model Development and Regression on a Laptop prices db
Hands-on practice lab: Model DevelopmentÂ¶
Estimated time needed: 45 minutes

In this lab, you will use the skills acquired in throughout the module, and use linear regression principles to create a model that predicts the Price of the laptop, based on one or more attributes of the dataset.







Objectives
After completing this lab you will be able to:

Use Linear Regression in one variable to fit the parameters to a model
Use Linear Regression in multiple variables to fit the parameters to a model
Use Polynomial Regression in single variable tofit the parameters to a model
Create a pipeline for performing linear regression using multiple features in polynomial scaling
Evaluate the performance of different forms of regression on basis of MSE and R^2 parameters
